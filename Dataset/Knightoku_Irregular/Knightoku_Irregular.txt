1. @Summary
Knight-less Sudoku.
2. Description
Knightoku is a Sudoku variant which plays mostly like Sudoku with one glaring exception.
Two tiles in a chess-like Knight jump configuration (i.e. L-shaped) can't contain the same numbers.
If that's confusing, just follow this rule: play normal Sudoku, but when you have to put a number in a tile, ensure that if you move like the knight in chess from that tile, you don't reach the same number. In other words, when putting a number in a tile, try to move 1 tile in one direction and 2 tiles in another from there. The tile you reach must contain a different number than the one you just inserted.
One of the Standard Sudoku rules apply
	a.	one number only can appear once in every row and column.
	b.	Instead of the classic 3x3 Sudoku, the game have irregular areas, one number only can appear once in one region.
3. Tips
a. You might want to use Notes quite often.
b. 'Knightoku', 'Odds are Even', 'Consecutives' and 'More or Less' are pretty close variants of Sudoku, however they can even appeal to those who don't like the base game, especially in later levels.
