1. @Summary
Plant Trees and Flowers with enough variety.
2. Description
Your goal as a Landscaper is to plant some Trees and Flowers on the field, in every available tile.
In doing this, you must assure the scenery is varied enough:
a. No more than two consecutive Trees or Flowers should appear horizontally or vertically.
b. Every row and column must have an equal number of Trees and Flowers.
c. Each row disposition must be unique, i.e. the same arrangement of Trees and Flowers can't appear on two rows.
d. Each column disposition must be unique as well.
3. Odd-size levels
Please note that in odd-sided levels, the number of Trees and Flowers obviously won't be equal on a row or column, however each row and column will have the same number of Flowers and Trees.
Also, the number of Trees will always be greater that than that of Flowers (i.e. 3 Flowers and 4 Trees, 4 Flowers and 5 Trees, etc.)
4. Tips
a. Don't forget the uniqueness rule, as this is often the best hint to progress.
b. If you see a space between two Trees or two Flowers, you already know what goes there.
