1. @Summary
This...looks...familiar...I thought you didn't like Sudokus?
2. Description
Odds Are Even is a Sudoku variant where the hints are given by differently shaded tiles.
Standard Sudoku rules apply
	a.	one number only can appear once in every row and column.

The brighter coloured tiles contain odd numbers (1,3,5,7,9) and the dim ones contain even numbers (2,4,6,8).

3. Tips
1. You might want to use Notes quite often.
2. 'Odds are Even', 'Consecutives' and 'More or Less' are pretty close variants of Sudoku, however they can even appeal to those who don't like the base game, especially in later levels.
