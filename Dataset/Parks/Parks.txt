1.	Summary
Plant one Tree in each Park, row and column. 
2.	Description
You have a few differently coloured areas (Parks) on the board.
The goal is to plant Trees, following these rules:
a.	A Tree can't touch another Tree, not even diagonally
b.	Each Park must have exactly 1 Tree
c.	There must be exactly 1 Tree in each row and each column
3.	Common Mistakes
Remember a Tree CAN NOT touch another Tree diagonally, but it CAN be on the same diagonal line.
Check the number or required Trees on the top right corner.
4.	Tips
You can start with smaller Parks, where a Tree often has only few possible positions. In the example, the Grey Park is only one tile big!
You might find it useful to mark with ? all the tiles in a Park, row and column where you have already found the Tree(s). Keep in mind that this is also valid for most games!!
