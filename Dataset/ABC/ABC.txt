1. Summary
Fill the board with ABC.
2. Description
In a similar way to 'Skyscrapers', your goal is to put the number 1 2 and 3 in the board.
Each letter appears once in every row and column, however, differently than Skyscrapers, this time you're told what letter you see first from the border.
Since most puzzles can contain empty spaces, the hint on the border doesn't always match the tile next to it.
In the example, the hints on the left border are 3-1-1-2.
So the solution of the first column can be either 3-1-.-2 or 3-.-1-2, leaving an empty space either in the second or third row.
In the example, the solution has the space in the second row, first column, which also forces the next tile (second row, second column) to contain an '1'.
Bigger puzzles can also contain the letter '4'. In these cases, the name of the puzzle is '1234'. Further on, you might also encounter '5', '6', etc.
3. Common Mistakes
The hint on the border tells you the FIRST letter you see from there. Not necessarily the one on the closest tile, which can be empty.
4. Tips
	a. Start with letters that appear only once on the border.
	b. Remember that not only a letter can appear only once in every column and row, but it HAS to appear once!
