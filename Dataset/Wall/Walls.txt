1. @Summary
Find the maze of Bricks.
2. Description
This game plays similar to 'Branches'.
However, this time, you have lines of Walls branching from the numbers, which tell you the total length of Wall segments connected to it.
The main difference with Branches, is that Wall pieces only have two ways to be put, horizontally or vertically.
Lastly, not every Wall piece must be connected with a number, but the board must be filled with Wall pieces.
3. Tips
a. You can mark a number with a circle by tapping on it, when you have discovered all its branches, but this is optional and not needed to solve the puzzle.
