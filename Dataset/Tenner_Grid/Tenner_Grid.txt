1.	@Summary
Counting up to 10.
2.	Description
Your goal is to enter every digit, from 0 to 9, in each row of the Grid.
The number on the bottom row gives you the sum for that column.
Digits can repeat on the same column, however digits in contiguous tiles must be different, even diagonally. Obviously digits can't repeat on the same row.
To put a number on the board, select it from the list on the bottom and tap the tile.
3.	Tips
a.	Start where you have more numbers available, but also check high or low sums.
b.	Remember you can't put two identical numbers in two consecutive tiles, not even diagonally.
