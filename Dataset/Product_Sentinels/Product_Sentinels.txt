1. @Summary
Multiplicative Towers
2. Description
Plays like 'Sentinels' (see rules) with this exception:
The numbers describe the 'Product' instead of the Sum, of the two directions.
In the example, the middle '20' Sentinel is seeing 4 tiles vertically and 5 tiles horizontally: 4x5 =20.
3. Tips
a. Obviously try Sentinels first!
b. Remember the restrictions are that there must be a single continuous Garden, and two Towers can't touch horizontally or vertically.
