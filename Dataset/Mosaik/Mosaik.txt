1. @Summary
Paint the mosaic, filling squares with the numbered hints..
2. Description
In Mosaik, there is a hidden image which can be discovered using the numbered hints.
A number tells you how many tiles must be filled in the 3x3 area formed by the tile itself and the ones surrounding it.
Thus the number can go from 0, where no tile is filled, to 9, where every tile is filled in a 3x3 area around the tile with the number.
Every number in between denotes that some of the tiles in that 3x3 area are filled and some are not.
It's up to you to find out which, check the Hints about this.
3. Warning
Mosaik can be very challenging and frustrating, even at simple levels. It can involve some forward-thinking and there can be times when it looks like there is no way to continue solving it. In there cases, it's advisable to stop and look at it again after a while.
4. Tips
a. Obviously start with painting around the 9s and marking as empty around the 0s, if available.
b. The borders are another source of good hints, since they remove some possibilities. This is particularly obvious when having a 6 on a border or a 4 in a corner.
c. You can also see where an area forces a number of tiles to be empty or filled for sure and how this affects neighboring hints.
