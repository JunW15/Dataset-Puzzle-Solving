1. @Summary
Fill the board with Branches departing from the numbers
2. Description
In Branches you must fill the board with straight horizontal and vertical lines (Branches) that stem from each number.
The number in itself tells you how many total tiles its Branches fill up. The tile with the number doesn't count.
For example, if a number says 4, it could be 1 up, 2 left and 1 down.
There can't be blank tiles and Branches can't overlap, nor run over the numbers. Moreover Branches must be in a single straight line and can't make corners.
Please note you can also mark a number with a circle by tapping on it, when you have discovered all its branches, but this is optional and not needed to solve the puzzle.
3. Tips
a. One good starting point is to notice squares which can be reached only by a particular number
b. Some big numbers will be forced to proceed in some directions, at least for a number of squares.
