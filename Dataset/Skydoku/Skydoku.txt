1. @Summary
Takes Sudoku to new heights!
2. Description
Plays like a cross between Sudoku and Skyscrapers.
Hints on the borders tell you - like Skyscrapers- how many buildings you see from there.
In the inner board regular Sudoku rules apply, you need to fill the board with numbers 1 to 9 in every row, column and area, without repetitions, except that in some levels you only have numbers 1 to 8.
3. Tips
a. Try to familiarize well with Skyscrapers first.
b. As in Skyscrapers, start with very low or very high hints.
