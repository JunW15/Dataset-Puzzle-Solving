1. @Summary
Win by not winning!
2. Description
The opposite of the famous game 'Connect Four', where you must line up four tokens of the same colour.
In this puzzle you have to ensure that there are no more than three tokens of the same colour lined up horizontally, vertically or diagonally.
3. Tips
Just start where there are three tokens lined up already.
Landscaper and Four-Me-Not are good practice for this.
