1.	@Summary
Each Camper wants his shade. But his privacy too!
2.	Description
The board represents a camping area with some Trees, under which Campers want to set their Tent.
This means they want to set their Tent horizontally or vertically adjacent to a Tree (diagonally doesn't count).
At the same time they need their privacy, so a Tent can't have another Tent touching, not even diagonally.
Numbers on the borders tell you how many Tents there are in that row or column. 
Harder levels can hide some numbers.
Finally, keep in mind these two rules:
a.	Each Tree has at least one Tent touching it, horizontally or vertically.
b.	There's the same exact number of Trees and Tents in the Camping Area.
3.	Common Mistakes
If you think you've found another solution for a level, please remember:
a.	A Tree must have at least one Tent touching it, horizontally or vertically!
Again, if you think the game doesn't accept a valid solution, triple check everything. We can assure you all the levels in the game have only one solution!
4.	Tips
Start by marking empty rows and columns and then check those with a lot of Tents or with very few Trees nearby.
