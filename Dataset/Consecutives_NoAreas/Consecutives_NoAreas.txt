1. @Summary
I believe you two already met??
2. Description
Consecutives can be seen as a mix between Sudoku and 'consecutive' Futoshiki.
One of the Standard Sudoku rules apply
	a.	one number only can appear once in every row and column.
The marks highlighted between two tiles tell you that those two numbers are Consecutives, like 1 and 2 or 3 and 4 or 6 and 5.
Please note that if there is no mark, there CAN'T be two consecutive numbers in the neighboring tiles.
3. Tips
a. You might want to use Notes quite often.
b. Use techniques similar to Consecutive Futoshiki
4. 'Odds are Even', 'Consecutives' and 'More or Less' are pretty close variants of Sudoku, however they can even appeal to those who don't like the base game, especially in later levels.
