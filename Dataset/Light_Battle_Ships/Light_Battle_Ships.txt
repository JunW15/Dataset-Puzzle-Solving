2. Description
A mix of Battle Ships and Lighthouses, you have to guess the usual piece of ships with the help of Lighthouses.
Each number is a Lighthouse, telling you how many pieces of ship there are in that row and column, summed together.
A ship or ship piece is worth the number it occupies on the board.
Ships cannot touch each other OR touch Lighthouses. Not even diagonally.
In each puzzle there are :
a. 1 Aircraft Carrier (4 squares)
b. 2 Destroyers (3 squares)
c. 3 Submarines (2 squares)
d. 4 Patrol boats (1 square)
3. Variant As in Battle Ships some levels have a Supertanker, which you will see in the top right corner.
4. Tips
a. Remember to fill blank space with dots.
b. Lighthouses themselves occupy a big chunk of water...
