1. @Summary
Jump once on every tile, following the arrows
2. Description
Starting at tile number1, reach the last tile (16 in the example) by jumping from tile to tile.
When jumping from a tile, you have to follow the direction of the arrow and land on a tile in that direction.
Although you have to follow the direction of the arrow, you can land on any tile in that direction, not just the one next to the current tile.
The goal is to jump on every tile, only once and reach the last tile.
3. Interface
You can find complete reference for the interface here.
You can also make the spinner auto advance with the top and bottom arrow.
4. Tips
a. You can note down sub-paths where an arrow can only point to a tile, even if it's not linked to the tiles you already discovered.
b. Hidden Paths can be challenging, especially the 5x5 or 6x6 boards.
