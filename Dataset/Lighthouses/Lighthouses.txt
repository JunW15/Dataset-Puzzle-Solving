1. @Summary
Lighten Up at Sea.
2. Description
Only apparently similar to Lighten Up, this time you're at sea and you need to find the lighthouses that light the boats.
Each boat has a number on it that tells you how many lighthouses are lighting it.
A lighthouse lights all the tiles horizontally and vertically and doesn't stop at boats or other lighthouses. A lighthouse lights at least one boat.
Finally, no boat touches another boat or lighthouse, not even diagonally. No lighthouse touches another lighthouse as well.
3. Tips
a. Remember lighthouses don't block themselves.
b. Mark as empty as many tiles as possible when stuck.
