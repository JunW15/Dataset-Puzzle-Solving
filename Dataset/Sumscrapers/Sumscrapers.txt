1.@Summary
Sum the Skyline!
2.Description
Please play 'Skyscrapers' first, as this is a variation of that game.
The central grid represents a city, as seen from above. Each square contains a Skyscraper, of different height.
The goal is to guess the height of each Skyscraper.
Skyscrapers height ranges from 1 to the size of the city: thus in the example Skyscrapers are numbered from 1 (lowest) to 4 (highest).
Each row and column can't have two similar Skyscrapers.
Outside the city, on the borders, the numbers indicate the 'Skyline'.
you the SUM of the heights of the Skyscrapers you see from there (looking inside the city), keeping in mind that a higher Skyscraper hides a lower one.
Harder levels can hide some numbers.
3.Tips
a.In the example, the 10 must be the sum of 1,2,3 and 4 - in that order.
b.And remember you're ALWAYS seeing the highest (4), so it's always included in the sum. So, when the sum is 4.
