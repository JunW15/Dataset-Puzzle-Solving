1. @Summary
Fill the rows and columns with numbers, respecting the relations
2. Description
In a manner similar to Sudoku, you have to put in each row and column numbers ranging from 1 to N, where N is the puzzle board size.
In the example above, it's 1 to 4
a. The hints you have line separating the tiles. 
b. That separator hints at two tiles with consecutive numbers, i.e. 1-2 or 2-3 or 3-4. 
c. Please note that in this variation consecutive numbers MUST have a line separating the tiles. Otherwise they're not consecutive!
d. This Variation is a taste of a similar game: 'Consecutives'.
Remember you can't repeat the same number in a row or column!
4. Tips
a. Check the rows and columns where a lot of minors/majors are present.
b. Also follow 'trails' of signs
c. If you like this, try 'More or Less' and 'Consecutives' too. Later levels are pretty similar to this
