1. Description
Plays with the same rules as Tapa with these variations:
1. At the end of the solution, the filled tiles will form an identical pattern to the one formed by the empty tiles.
2. It’s basically like having the same figure rotated or reversed in the opposite colour. The two figures will have the same exact shape.
