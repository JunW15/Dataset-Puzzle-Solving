1. Description
The board represents a parking lot seen from above.
Each number identifies a car and all cars are identified by a number, there are no hidden cars.
Cars can be regular sports cars (2x1 tiles) or limousines (3x1 tiles) and can be oriented horizontally or vertically.
The number in itself specifies how far the car can move forward or backward, in tiles.
For example, a car that has one tile free in front and one tile free in the back, would be marked with a ‘2’.
Find all the cars!!
1. Tips
1. Looks for tight spots, corners and places where two numbers touch.
2. Blue and Red are only given as visual cues for vertical and horizontal cars.
