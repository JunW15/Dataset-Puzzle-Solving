1. @Summary
Place lightbulbs to light up all the room squares
1. Description
What you see from above is a room and the marked squares are walls.
The goal is to put lightbulbs in the room so that all the blank(non-wall) squares are lit, following these rules:
1. Lightbulbs light all free, unblocked, squares horizontally and vertically.
2. A lightbulb can’t light another lightbulb.
3. Walls block light. Also walls with a number tell you how many lightbulbs are adjacent to it, horizontally and vertically.
4. Walls without a number can have any number of lightbulbs. However, lightbulbs don’t need to be adjacent to a wall.
1. Tips
1. Try to use the walls first, then you’ll notice the light of the lightbulbs you placed will give you more hints.
2. Remember that lightbulbs can be far away from a wall.
