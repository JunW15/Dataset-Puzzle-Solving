We used to guard a castle, you know?
1. Description
The goal is to draw a single, uninterrupted, closed loop, similar to slitherlink.
The loop goes around all the numbers.
The numbers tell you how many cells you can see horizontally and vertically from there, including the cell itself (like Wall Sentinels)
1. Variant
Some levels are marked ‘Inside Outside’. In this case some numbers are on the outside of the loop.
1. Tips
1. Start with large numbers.
2. Inside/Outside can be pretty challenging.
