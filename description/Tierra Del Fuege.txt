1. @Summary
Fuegians!
1. Description
The board represents the ‘Tierra Del Fuego’ archipelago, where native tribes, the Fuegians, live.
Being organized in tribes, each tribe, marked with a different letter, has occupied an island in the archipelago.
The archipelago is peculiar because all bodies of water separating the islands are identical in shape and occupy a 2x1 or 1x2 space.
These bodies of water can only touch diagonally.
Your task is to find these bodies of water.
Please note there are no hidden tribes or islands without a tribe on it.
1. Tips
1. Look for very distant letter pairs or groups
2. Practice Archipelago first
