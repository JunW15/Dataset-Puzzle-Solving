1.@Summary
No Bridges, just find the water.
2.Description
Each number represents a rectangular island in the Archipelago.
The number in itself identifies how many squares the island occupies.
Islands can only touch each other diagonally and by touching they must form a network where no island is isolated from the others.
In other words, every island must be touching another island diagonally and no group of islands must be separated from the others.
Not all the islands you need to find are necessarily marked by numbers.
Finally, no 2x2 square can be occupied by water only (just like Nurikabe).
3.Tips
a.Similar to Nurikabe, but with a different twist regarding the diagonally touching islands.
b.Small numbers help, naturally. But also bigger islands are often constraint in shape.
