1. @Summary
Tetris without the fat guy
1. Description
You play this game with all the Tetris pieces, except the square one.
So in other words you use pieces of four squares (tetrominos) in the shape of L, I, T and S, which can also be rotated or reflected (mirrored).
The board is divided into many areas. You have to place a tetromino into each are respecting these rule；
1. No two adjacent (touching horizontally/vertically) tetrominos should be of equal shape, even counting rotations or reflections)
2. All the shaded cells should form a valid Nurikabe (hence no fat guy)
1. Tips
1. Remember each piece can be ratated or mirrored, thereby representing all pieces of tetris, except the square.
2. Try Nurikabe first.
