1. @Summary
Find all the Domino tiles.
1. Description
On the board there is a complete Domino set. The Domino tiles borders however aren’t marked, and it’s up to you to identify them.
Each Domino tile is composed by two numbers and that combination appears only once in the Domino set.
In the example (and in early levels) the board contains a smaller Domino set of numbers ranging from 0 to 3.
This means you will be looking for a Domino set composed of these combinations:
0-0,0-1,0-2,0-3
1-1,1-2,1-3
2-2,2-3
3-3
In harder levels, the Domino set will also include fours fives, sixes, etc.
1. Tips
1. Look first for unique combinations, that will in turn remove some other possibilities.
2. Numbers in corners or borders can only be linked to 2 or 3 other numbers, which is easier than those in the middle of the board.
