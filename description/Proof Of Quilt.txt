1. @Summary
Quilt the board, following the hints.
1. Description
The goal is to place triangles in some cells in the end generating a pattern similar to a Quilt.
The numbered tiles tell you how many triangles share an edge with it, horizontally and vertically.
For example, if a tile says 4, it has triangles all around it.
If a tile says 1, it has only one triangle somewhere.
Some tiles will remain blank and will form, along with the triangles, rectangles and squares.
These can be tilted by 45 degrees.
Some other tiles are filled but contain no number. These and the hints are the only tiles that can be completely filled.
Rectangles or squares can’t touch orthogonally, but can touch diagonally.
1. Tips
1. Obviously start with 4’s, edges with 3’s or corners with 2’s and with 0’s.
2. Rectangles can be quite long, but somehow the hints can reduce the possible size.
