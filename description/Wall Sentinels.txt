1. @Summary
It’s midnight and all is well!
1. Description
On the board there is a single, continuous castle wall, which you must discover.
The numbers on the board represent Sentinels (in a similar way to ‘Sentinels’).
The Sentinels can be placed on the Wall or Land.
The number tells you how many titles that Sentinel can control (see) from there vertically and horizontally – of his type of tile.
Hat means the number of a Land Sentinel indicates how many Land tiles are visible from there, up to Wall tiles or the grid border.
That works the opposite way for Wall Sentinels: they control all the Wall tiles up to Land tiles or the grid border.
The number includes the tile itself, where the Sentinel is located (again, like ‘Sentinels’)
Lastly there is a single, orthogonally contiguous, Wall and it can’t contain 2x2 Wall tiles – just like Nuikabe.
1. Tips
1. Try Nrikabe and Sentinels first.
2. Check the very low numbers first or the very big ones.
