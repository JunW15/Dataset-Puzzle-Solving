1. Summary
Follow the winding path with numbers 1, 2 and 3.
2. Description
The goal is to start at the entrance in the top left corner and proceed towards the center, leaving a trail of numbers.
Numbers appear on the path in the sequence 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3… with some empty tiles in between and must follow these rules:
   1. Trail Rule: The first number after entering in the snail is a 1 and the last before ending in the center is a 3. In between, the 1, 2, 3 sequence will be repeated, following the snail path.
   2. Board Rule: Each row and column of the board (disregarding the snail path) must have exactly a 1, a 2 and a 3.
As you can see from the example, not even the first tile must contain a digit, but the first number after entering the snail must be a 1.
After that the 1, 2, 3 sequence repeats itself many times, with the last one being a 3 (not necessarily on the last tile).
   1. Variant
Some later levels will have numbers 1, 2, 3 and 4. You will see the number 4 on the top right.
   1. Tips
You might find it useful to count all possible spaces between the numbers already on the board, as well as the beginning and the end of the trail.
