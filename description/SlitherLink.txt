1. @Summary
Draw a loop a-la-minesweeper!
1. Description
Draw a single looping path with the aid of the numbered hints. The path cannot have branches or cross itself.
Each number in a tile tells you on how many of its four sides are touched by the path
For example:
1. A 0 tells you that the path doesn’t touch that square at all.
2. At 1 tells you that the path touches that square ONLY on one side.
3. A 3 tells you that the path does a U-turn around that square.
4. There can’t be tiles marked with 4 because they would form a single closed loop in it.
Empty tiles can have any number of sides touched by the path.
1. Tips
1. Start marking with ‘x’ obvious places where the path cannot be (0s are the easiest to mark).
2. It’s usually easy to mark double 3s or 3s on the corner.
1. Interface
1. Tap between tiles to toggle the path there, between Undefined, Marked and Unmarked (with a tiny x).
2. In bigger levels you might want to zoom in.
3. This puzzle doesn’t allow taking Notes when holding your finger on a tile.
