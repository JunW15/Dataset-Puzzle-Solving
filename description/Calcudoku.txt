1. @Summary
Mathematical Sudoku
1. Description
Write numbers ranging from 1 to board size (1 to 4 in the example) respecting the calculation hint.
The tiny numbers and math signs in the corner of an area give you the hint about what’s happening inside that area.
For example a ‘3+’ means that the sum of the numbers inside that area equals 3. In that case you would have to write the numbers 1 and 2 there.
Another example: ‘12x’ means that the multiplication of the numbers in that area gives 12, so it could be 3 and 4 or even 3, 4 and 1, depending on the area size.
Even where the order of the operands matter (in subtraction and division) they can appear in any order inside the area (i.e. 2÷ could be done with 4 and 2 or 2 and 4).
All the numbers appear just one time in each row and column, but they could be repeated in non-straight areas, like the L-shaped one in the example.
1. Tips
1. Some areas will force you to use a particular couple sets of numbers.
2. You will probably need to take notes with the numbers that can go in a tile.
3. Math isn’t a big requirement but it can help to remember prime numbers, divisions, etc.
