1. @Summary
Mr. Futoshiki, meet Mr. Sudoku.
1. Description
More Or Less can be seen as a mix between Sudoku and Futoshiki.
Standard Sudoku rules apply, i.e. you need to fill the board with numbers 1 to 9 in every row, column and area, without repetitions.
The hints however, are given by the Greater Than or Less Than symbols between tiles.
1. Variation
Further levels have irregular areas, instead of the classic 3x3 Sudoku. All the other rules are the same.
1. Tips
1. You might want to use Notes quite often.
2. Start with lowest (1,2) and highest (9,8) numbers, then work towards the middle.
