1. Summary
   1. Play solo battleships, with the help of the numbers on the border.
1. Description
Standard rules of Battleships apply, but you are guessing the other player ships disposition, by using the numbers on the borders.
Each number tells you how many ship or ship pieces you’re seeing in that row or column.
Standard rules apply: a ship or piece of ship can’t touch another, not even diagonally.
In each puzzle there are :
1. 1 Aircraft Carrier (4 squares)
2. 2 Destroyers (3 squares)
3. 3 Submarines (2 squares)
4. 4 Patrol boats (1 square)
1. Tips
1. Start with the lines marked with 0.
2. Try to find the Aircraft Carrier as there are only a few places where it can be.
3. If you get bored by tapping multiple times a tile, check the Settings page for the possible upgrade (this feature is coming up).
4. The touch interface can be fiddly for this games at times, you might want to zoom in or use the ‘undo’ button when pressing the wrong tile.
