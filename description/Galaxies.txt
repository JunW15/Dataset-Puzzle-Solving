1. @Summary
Fine the Symmetric Spiral Galaxies.
1. Description
In the board there are marked the centers of a few ‘Spiral’ Galaxies.
There Galaxies are symmetrical to a rotation of 180 degrees. This means that rotating the shape of the Galaxy by 180 degrees (half a full turn) around the center, will result in an identical shape.
Check the solved example for a few simple shapes.
In the end, all the space must be included in Galaxies and Galaxies can’t overlap.
There can be single tile Galaxies (with the center inside it) and some Galaxy centers will be across two or four tiles.
1. Tips
1. Test whether some tiles can be reached by a Galaxy by seeing if the Galaxy can go the same length/path in the opposite, symmetrical way.
2. If in doubt, rotate the phone and see if a Galaxy is indeed symmetrical.
3. In bigger levels some Galaxies will have weird shapes.
1. Interface
1. Tap between tiles to toggle the path there, between Undefined, Marked and Unmarked (with a tiny x).
2. In bigger levels you might want to zoom in. You also need to mark the borders of the board.
3. This puzzle doesn’t allow to take Notes when holding your finger on a tile.
