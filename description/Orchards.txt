1. @Summary
Plant the trees. Very close, this time!
1. Description
In a revers of ‘Parks’, you’re now planting Trees close together in neighboring country areas.
There are Apple Trees, which must cross-pollinate, thus must be planted in pairs – horizontally or vertically touching.
A Tree must be touching just one other Tree: you can’t put three or more contiguous Trees.
At the same time, like in Parks, every country area must have exactly two Trees in it.
1. Tips
1. Looks like Parks, but plays more like Gardener. Don’t mistake yourself with row/column rules of Parks.
2. Two tile areas obviously are going to be filled with Trees.
3. Start where there are many smallish areas.
