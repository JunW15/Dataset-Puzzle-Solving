1. @Summary
Close the doors between Rooms.
1. Description
The view of the board is a castle with every tile identifying a Room. Between Rooms there are doors that can be open or closed. At the start of the game all doors are open.
Each number inside a Room tells you how many other Rooms you see from there, in a straight line horizontally or vertically when the appropriate doors are closed.
This is similar to the ‘Sentinels’ puzzle, however this time you don’t count the Room itself in the number.
At the end of the solution, each Room must be reachable from the others. That means no single Room or group of Rooms can be divided by the others.
For example, the ‘1’ in the bottom left corner, says that one of the two doors (being in the corner the only doors available are the top and right ones) is closed and that the other will be opened. However after this opened door, there will only be one more Room visible (hence the number 1) and the next door in that direction will be closed.
In harder levels some tiles won’t tell you how many Rooms are visible at all.
1. Tips
1. Try to use crosses to mark the open path as much as possible.
2. Rooms can be challenging, especially when there are non-numbered tiles.
