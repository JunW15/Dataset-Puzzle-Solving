1. @Summary
Draw a single loop, minesweeper style.
1. Description
Similar to Slitherlink, the goal is to draw a single closed loop never crosses itself or branches off.
A number in a cell denotes how many of the 8 adjacent cells are passed by the loop.
The loop can only go horizontally or vertically between cells, but not over the numbers.
The loop doesn’t need to cover all the board.
1. Tips
1. You can use similar techniques as Slitherlink and Minesweeper.
2. Numbers on the borders are always useful
1. Interface
1. Drag slowly to toggle lines.
2. You can also tap between tiles to toggle a line segment (and zoom for bigger levels).
3. This puzzle doesn’t allow you to take Notes when holding your finger on a tile.
