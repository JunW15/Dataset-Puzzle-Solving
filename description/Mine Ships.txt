1. @Summary
Warning! Naval Mines in the water!
1. Description
There are actually no mines in the water, but this is a mix between ‘Minesweeper’ and ‘Battle Ships’.
You must find the same set of ships like ‘Battle Ships’ (1x4,2x3,3x2,4x1).
However this time the hints are given in the same form as ‘Minesweeper’, where a number tells you how many pieces of ship are around it.
Usual Battle Ships rules apply!
1. Tips
1. Plays more similar to Minesweeper than Battle Ships.
2. Some future levels (yet to be developed) might include the Super-Tanker.
