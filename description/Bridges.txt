1. @Summary
Enough Sudoku, let’s build!
1. Description
The Board represents a Sea with some Islands on it.
You must connect all the Islands with Bridges, making sure every Island is connected to each other with a Bridges path.
The number on each Island tells you how many Bridges are touching that Island.
Bridges can only run horizontally or vertically and can’t cross each other.
Lastly, you can connect two Islands with either one or two Bridges (or none, of course).
1. Tips
1. Corners!
2. Big numbers can be helpful too.
