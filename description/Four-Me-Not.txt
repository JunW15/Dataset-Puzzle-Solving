1. @Summary
It seems we do a lot of gardening in this game!
1. Description
In Four-Me-Not (or Forbidden Four) you need to create a continuous flower bed without putting four flowers in a row.
More exactly, you have to join the existing flowers by adding more of them, creating a single path of flowers touching horizontally or vertically.
At the same time, you can’t line up horizontally or vertically more than 3 flowers (thus Forbidden Four).
Some tiles are marked as squares and are just fixed blocks.
1. Tips
1. The original Japanese name of the puzzle is ‘Fobido 4’, from the Japanese pronunciation of ‘Forbidden Four’.
2. Fixed Flowers are marked with a dot. You should also mark sure-empty tiles as soon as possible.
