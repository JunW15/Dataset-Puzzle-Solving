1. @Summary
Connect the same numbers without crossing paths.
1. Description
Connect the couples of equal numbers (i.e. 2 with 2, 3 with 3, etc.) with a continuous line.
The line can only go horizontally or vertically and can’t cross itself or other lines.
Lines must originate on a number and must end in the other equal number.
At the end of the puzzle, you must have covered ALL the squares with lines and no line can cover a 2*2 area (like a 180 degree turn).
In other words you can’t turn right and immediately right again. The same happens on the left, obviously. Be careful not to miss this rule.
1. Variant
1. In some levels there will be a note that tells you don’t need to cover all the squares
2. In some levels you will have more than a couple of the same number. In these cases, you must connect ALL the same numbers together.
1. Tips
1. Check the more distant numbers as they often need to do a winding path.
1. Interface
1. Drag *slowly* to toggle lines.
2. You can also tap between tiles to toggle a line segment (and zoom for bigger levels).
3. This puzzle doesn’t allow taking Notes when holding you finger on a tile.
