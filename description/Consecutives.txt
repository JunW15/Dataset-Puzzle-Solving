1. @Summary
I believe you two already met??
1. Description
Consecutives can be seen as a mix between Sudoku and ’consecutive’ Futoshiki.
Standard Sudoku rules apply, i.e. you need to fill the board with numbers 1 to 9 in every row, column and area, without repetitions.
The marks highlighted between two tiles tell you that those two numbers are Consecutives, like 1 and 2 or 3 and 4 or 6 and 5.
Please note that if there is no mark, there CAN’T be two consecutive numbers in the neighboring tiles.
1. Variation
   Further levels have irregular areas, instead of the classic 3x3 Sudoku. All the other rules are the same.
Even further, you will find levels that have NO areas.
1. Tips
1. You might want to use Notes quite often.
2. Use techniques similar to Consecutive Futoshiki
3. ‘Odds are Even’, ‘Consecutives’ and ‘More or Less’ are pretty close variants of Sudoku, however they can even appeal to those who don’t like the base game, especially in later levels.
