1. @Summary
Zip, swish, zoom! Lasers on mirrors!
1. Important Note
This puzzle has multiple solutions on some levels: they will all be recognized by the game.
HOWEVER the hint engine will only give you hints towards a single, predetermined solution.
So you should probably avoid hints completely :)
1. Description
The goal is to draw a single, continuous, non-crossing, path that fills the entire board.
Some tiles are already given and can contain Mirrors, which force the path to make a turn. Other tiles already contain a fixed piece of straight path.
Some other tiles have blocks, which can’t be crossed and can be ignored.
Your task is to fill the remaining board tiles with straight or 90° path lines, in the end connecting a single, continuous line.
Please note you can make 90°turn even where there are no mirrors.
1. Variant
Mirrors puzzles aren’t usually very difficult, however the Maze variant can be a bit more challenging.
In the Maze variant, the path isn’t closed. You have two spots on the board which represent the start and end of the path.
1. Tips
1. Check tight places, behind ‘walls’ and ‘mirrors’ and near the borders or corners
2. Please note this ‘lines’ puzzle has a standard ‘tapping’ interface and you can also take notes.
