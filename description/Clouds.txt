1. Description
Clouds is a variant of Battle Ships where you must find Clouds in the sky.
The hints on the borders tell you how many tiles are covered by Clouds in that row or column.
Clouds only appear in rectangular or square areas. Furthermore, their width and height is always at least two tiles wide.
Lastly, Clouds – like Battleships – can’t touch between themselves, not even diagonally. 
1. Tips
1. Try to play Battleships first, Clouds can be harder with bigger boards.
2. The strongest hint is that Clouds can’t be less than 2 tiles wide in both directions.
