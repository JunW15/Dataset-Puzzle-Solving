1. Summary
Draw a continuous wall that divides gardens as big as the numbers.
1. Description
Each number on the grid indicates a garden, occupying as many tiles as the number itself.
Gardens can have any form, extending horizontally and vertically, but can’t extend diagonally.
The gardens are separated by a single, continuous wall. This means all wall tiles on the board must be connected horizontally or vertically. There can’t be isolated walls.
You must find and mark the wall following these rules:
1. All the gardens in the puzzle are numbered at the start, there are no hidden gardens.
2. A wall can’t go over numbered squares.
3. The wall can’t form 2x2 squares.
1. Tips
   1. Nurikabe can be a bit difficult at start. Try putting the wall in tiles between numbers first.
   2. When stuck, remember that there can’t be 2x2 walls, there are often areas only a particular garden can reach.
