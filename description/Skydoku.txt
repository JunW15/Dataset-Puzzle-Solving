1. @Summary
Takes Sudoku to new heights!
1. Description
Plays like a cross between Sudoku and Skyscrapers.
Hints on the borders tell you – like Skyscrapers- how many buildings you see from there.
In the inner board regular Sudoku rules apply, except that in some levels you only have numbers 1 to 8.
1. Tips
1. Try to familiarize well with Skyscrapers first.
2. As in Skyscrapers, start with very low or very high hints.
