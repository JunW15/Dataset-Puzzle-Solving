1. @Summary
This time the campers wont’ have their way!
1. Description
This time the report is an island, the place is packed and the campers (Tents) must compromise!
The board represents an Island, where there are a few Tents, identified by the numbers.
Your job is to find the water surrounding the island, with these rules:
1. There is only one, continuous Island.
2. The numbers tell you how many tiles that camper can walk from his Tent, by moving horizontally and vertically. A camper can’t cross water or other Tents
So in the example, the top left ‘2’ can walk one tile east, then one tile south, thus 1+1=2.
1. Tips
1. Please note there’s no 2x2 rule here as in Nurikabe.
2. Try to work with two numbers together at a time.
