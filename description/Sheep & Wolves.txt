1. @Summary
Where’s a god when you need one?
1. Description
Play like slitherlink:
Draw a single looping path with the aid of the numbered hints. The path cannot have branches or cross itself.
Each number in a tile tells you on how many of its four sides are touched by the path.
With this added rule:
In the end all the sheep must be corralled inside the loop, while all the wolves must be outside.
1. Tips
1. Can be pretty hard, practicing a lot of slitherlink definitely helps.
2. Remember there must be a loop which has the sheep inside, so if you see a wolf far from the border it can be a good hint.
3. Besides the obvious sheep/wolves separation points, try to follow how the seep area can develop.
