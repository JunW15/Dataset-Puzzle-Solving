1. @Summary
Fill the board with number 1 to 9 according to the sum.
1. Description
Your goal is to write a number in every blank tile (those without a diagonal line)
The numbers you see in the tiles with diagonal lines are hints in the form of sum.
The small number in the top right corner tells you the sum of the digits to its right.
The small number in the bottom left corner tells you the sum of the digits under it.
You can enter digits ranging from 1 to 9. No same number should appear in a row or column.
In some instances, in bigger puzzles, two separate lines of contiguous digits will be on the same row, however they will be separated by a diagonal-line tile.
In this case the above rule doesn’t apply for the entire row: i.e. You could have the same digit in the left group of tiles and the right one.
The same applies for columns.
Tiles which have a diagonal line without numbers aren’t used in the game.
1. Tips
1. There are usually some points where a very large or small sum will force you to put only a range of numbers in a row or column.
2. You will probably need to take notes with the numbers that can go in a tile very often.
3. Kakuro can be a tad frustrating as you need a bit of “thinking-ahead” in some places, but it can be rewarding.
