1. @Summary
Which is a little Tatami
1. Description
Plays like Fillomino, in which you have to guess areas on the board marked by their number.
In Tatamino, however, you only have areas 1,2 and 3 tiles big.
Please remember two areas of the same number can’t be touching.
1. Tips
1. The main difference with Fillomino is that even big boards only have three numbers.
2. Tiles marked with one are already self – defined areas.
