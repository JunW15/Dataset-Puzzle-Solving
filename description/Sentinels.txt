1. @Summary
This time it’s one Garden and many Towers
1. Description
On the Board there are a few Sentinels, marked with a number.
The number tells you how many tiles that Sentinel can control (see) from there, vertically and horizontally.
This includes the tile where he is located, and all free tiles north, south, east and west of the Sentinel itself.
Your task is to place Towers in accordance with there hints, keeping in mind that a Tower blocks the Sentinel View.
The restrictions are:
1. There must be a single continuous Garden.
2. Two Towers can’t touch horizontally or vertically.
In the example, the bottom left ‘5’ Sentinel is seeing 3 tiles North, 1 tile East and the tile where is, making a total of 5.
Towers can’t go over numbered squares. But numbered squares don’t block Sentinel View.
1. Tips
1. Try Nurikabe first, as this is probably harder. Contrary to Nurikabe, there is a single, continuous garden: all its tiles must be connected horizontally and vertically.
2. Check the very low numbers first or the very big ones.
3. Remember that Towers can only touch diagonally.
