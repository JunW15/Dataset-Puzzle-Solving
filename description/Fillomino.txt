1. @Summary
Detect areas marked by their extension
1. Description
The goal is to detect areas marked with the tile count of the are itself.
So for example, areas marked ‘1’, will always consist of one single tile. Areas marked with ‘2’ will consist of two (horizontally or vertically) adjacent tiles.
This numbered ‘3’ will appear in group of three and so on.
Two areas with the same number can’t be horizontally or vertically touching.
Lastly, please note that some areas can also be totally hidden at the start. In the example you can see a ‘1’ which wasn’t hinted in the initial setup.
1. Variation
Fillomino has several variants, you can see it in the top right part of the screen.
1. No Rectangles: Areas can’t form Rectangles
2. Only Rectangles: Areas can ONLY form Rectangles.
3. Non-Consecutive: Areas can’t touch another area which has +1 or -1 as number (orthogonally).
4. Consecutive: Areas MUST touch another area which has +1 or -1 as number (orthogonally).
5. No Row or Column Repeats: Different areas with the same number can’t appear on the same column or row.
6. All Odds: There are only odd numbers on the board.
7. All Evens: There are only even numbers on the board.
1. Tips
1. Start with smaller or forced areas.
2. In some places an area would become too big if it touched an area with the same number.
