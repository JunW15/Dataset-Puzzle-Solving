Angled Walls
1. Description
In this game you have to create a valid Nurikabe following a different type of hints.
In the end, the empty spaces left by the Nurikabe will form many Carpenter’s Squares (L shaped tools) of different size.
The circled numbers on the board indicate the corner of the L.
When a number is inside the circle, that indicates the total number of squares occupied by the L.
The arrows always sites at the end of an arm and points to the corner of an L.
Not all the Carpenters’ Squares might be indicates: some could be hidden and no hint given.
1. Tips
1. The Nurikabe will give the indication where there are ‘hidden’ Carpenter’s Square
2. See where very big L’s have to go and try to match them with others near them.
