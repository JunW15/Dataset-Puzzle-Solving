1. @Summary
This…looks...familiar…I thought you didn’t like Sudokus?
1. Description
Odds Are Even is a Sudoku variant where the hints are given by differently shaded tiles.
Standard Sudoku rules apply, i.e. you need to fill the board with numbers 1 to 9 in every row, column and area, without repetitions.
The brighter coloured tiles contain odd numbers (1,3,5,7,9) and the dim ones contain even numbers (2,4,6,8).
1. Variation
   Further levels have irregular areas, instead of the classic 3x3 Sudoku. All the other rules are the same.
        Even further, you will find levels that have NO areas.
1. Tips
1. You might want to use Notes quite often.
2. ‘Odds are Even’, ‘Consecutives’ and ‘More or Less’ are pretty close variants of Sudoku, however they can even appeal to those who don’t like the base game, especially in later levels.
