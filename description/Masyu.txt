1. @Summary
Draw a Necklace that goes through every Pearl.
1. Description
The goal is to draw a single loop (Necklace) through every circle (Pearl) that never branches-off or crosses itself.
The rules to pass Pearls are:
1. Lines passing through White Pearls must go straight through them.
However, at least at one side of the White Pearl (or both), they must do a 90 degree turn.
1. Lines passing through Black Pearls must do a 90 degree turn in them.
Then, they must go straight for the next tile in both directions.
                Lines passing where there are no Pearls can do what they want.
                If you have trouble understanding these rules try to figure this:
                On a Black Pearl, always perform a 90 degree turn.
                On a White Pearl, always go straight.
                Then, after having this clear, remember:
                Before and after the Black Pearl, you can’t turn, you have to go straight.
                Before OR after the White Pearl, there must be AT LEAST one turn.
1. Tips
1. Start at the angles or borders and look for Black Pearls.
2. After a while, you might notice that White Pearls give you even more info than Black Pearls.
1. Interface
1. Drag -slowly- to toggle lines.
2. You can also tap between tiles to toggle a line segment (and zoom for bigger levels)
3. This puzzle doesn’t allow taking Notes when holding your finger on a tile.
