1. Description
Play like Solo Battle Ships, with a difference.
Each nnumber on the outer border tells you the SUM of the ship or ship pieces you’re seeing in that row or column.
A ship or ship piece is worth the number it occupies on the board.
Standard rules apply: a ship or piece of ship can’t touch another, not even diagonally.
In each puzzle there are :
1. 1 Aircraft Carrier (4 squares)
2. 2 Destroyers (3 squares)
3. 3 Submarines (2 squares)
4. 4 Patrol boats (1 square)
1. Variant
Some puzzle can also have a
1. 1 Supertanker (5 squares)
In these cases, you will see it noted in the top right.
1. Tips
1. Start with the lines marked with 0.
2. Big or small sums can restrict the available places where you can mark a ship.
3. Try to find the Aircraft Carrier as there are only a few places where it can be.
4. If you get bored by tapping multiple times a tile, check the Settings page for the possible upgrade (this feature is coming up).
