1. @Summary
Place Magnets on the board, respecting the orientation of poles.
1. Description
Each Magnet has a positive (+) and negative (-) pole.
Every rectangle can either contain a Magnet or be empty.
The number on the border tells you how many positive and negative poles you can see from there in a straight line.
When placing a Magnet, you have to respect the rule that the same pole (+ and + / - and -) can’t be adjacent horizontally or vertically.
In some levels, a few numbers on the border can be hidden.
1. Tips
1. Start either where there are lots of poles or where there is a 0.
2. When you know a tile has either a + and -, consider that you already know the other half of the Magnet isn’t empty.
3. Examining the rows or columns where there is a big difference in poles can be helpful at times.
