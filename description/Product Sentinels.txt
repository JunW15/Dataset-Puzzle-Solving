1. @Summary
Multiplicative Towers
1. Description
Plays like ‘Sentinels’ (see rules) with this exception:
The numbers describe the ‘Product’ instead of the Sum, of the two directions.
In the example, the middle ‘20’ Sentinel is seeing 4 tiles vertically and 5 tiles horizontally: 4x5 =20.
1. Tips
1. Obviously try Sentinels first!
2. Remember the restrictions are that there must be a single continuous Garden, and two Towers can’t touch horizontally or vertically.

Sentinels(On the Board there are a few Sentinels, marked with a number.
The number tells you how many tiles that Sentinel can control (see) from there, vertically and horizontally.
This includes the tile where he is located, and all free tiles north, south, east and west of the Sentinel itself.
Your task is to place Towers in accordance with there hints, keeping in mind that a Tower blocks the Sentinel View.)
