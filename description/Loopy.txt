1. @Summary
Loop a loop! And touch all the dots!
1. Description
Similar to Slitherlink, draw a single looping path. This time however there are no numbers, but you have to touch all the dots. As usual, the path cannot have branches or cross itself.
This game initially seems a slight variation of Slitherlink, but it requires different techniques and reasoning.
It might seem easy at start, but harder levels can be challenging. It’s also one of the few puzzles without numbers, letters or symbols.
