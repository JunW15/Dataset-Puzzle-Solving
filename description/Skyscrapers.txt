1. Summary
Guess Skyscrapers from the Skyline.
1. Description
The central grid represents a city, as seen from above. Each square contains a Skyscraper, of different height.
The goal is to guess the height of each Skyscraper.
Skyscrapers height ranges from 1 to the size of the city: thus in the example Skyscrapers are numbered from 1 (lowest) to 4 (highest).
Each row and column can’t have two similar Skyscrapers.
Outside the city, on the borders, the numbers indicate the ‘Skyline’.
The skyline tells you how many Skyscrapers you can see from there (looking inside the city), keeping in mind that a higher Skyscraper hides a lower one.
Harder levels can hide some numbers.
Please check the Tutorial for a few examples and clarifications.
1. Common mistakes
Remember: the hint on the border tells you how many Skyscrapers you see from there.
Instead a digit on the board (city) represents how tall that building is!
1. Tips
   1. Try to find places where you see one Skyscraper or all of them.
   2. Remember a Skyscraper height can only appear once in each row and column.
