1. Description
A mix of Battle Ships and Lighthouses, you have to guess the usual piece of ships with the help of Lighthouses.
Each number is a Lighthouse, telling you how many pieces of ship there are in that row and column, summed together.
Ships cannot touch each other OR touch Lighthouses. Not even diagonally.
1. Variant As in Battle Ships some levels have a Supertanker, which you will see in the top right corner.
2. Tips
1. Remember to fill blank space with dots.
2. Lighthouses themselves occupy a big chunk of water…
3. If you get bored by tapping multiple times a tile, check the Settings page for the possible upgrade.
